                        <p><h3>What's a Payment Gateway?</h3></p><p>
Basically, a gateway can be thought of as a bridge or "secure connection" from the bank to your storefront allowing your customers to make credit card purchases that directly deposit into your bank accounts.
</p><p><h3>
Do I need one?</p><p></h3>
To accept credit, debit, or Interac Online transactions, yes.
</p><p>
If the term sounds new you may be used to hearing it referred to as merchant services or just bundled in as a "silent partner" with your overall merchant account.
</p><p>
Simply put, merchant accounts (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover, etc.) and payment gateways go hand-in-hand. The merchant-customer transaction experience requires both - no exceptions.
</p><p><h3>
What do you offer?</h3></p><p>
Besides a gateway (or gateways) for your business - we'll help you with everything you need to get the gateway up and running.
<h3></p><p>
What does that entail?
</h3></p><p>
Free open source software
Ongoing customer support (Knowledge Base, Forum, Email, Phone)
Liaising with your bank & developer
Providing gateway services means much more than just providing a secure connection for your transactions. We also give you tools to manage these transactions and understand your revenue flow. Daily transaction email reports, online detailed and summary transaction reports, one-touch refunds and transaction voiding, virtual POS terminal, and CSV downloads to name a few. And something more is always in the development queue.</p>

Email Notifications</p><p>
It's easy to keep on top of your transaction activity with simple email summaries delivered right to your email inbox. Your choice of daily and/or monthly email reports include summaries of account activity and totals.
</p><p>
Transaction Searching</p><p>
We keep a complete history of your transactions and make them available through a flexible search interface. Our secure data storage capabilities means that you have access to all the information you'll need - with none of the risk.
</p><p>
Quickly find answers to questions about specific transactions or search for groups of transactions to learn more about how your customers do business.</p>

                        <p><h3>Hosted Payment Pages</h3></p><p>
E-commerce is risk business. Our hosted Payment Page service, is the most secure, cost-effective option for ecommerce website merchants. Get the money, leave the risk and let E-xact shoulder the burden of PCI compliance.
</p><p>
No one wants to have to constantly go back and update their software. It's expensive, time-consuming, and takes focus away from your primary concern: your business.
</p><p>
Offload the risk and take the rewards
Develop once and reap the benefits as they're added - however many times that happens. With Payment Pages, once you're up and running adding a new feature like Verified by Visa or Paypal can take as little as one button click.
</p><p>
All of the benefits - none of the liability. Storing card data is a high-risk undertaking that requires constant attention and vigilance, something few merchants (if any) can afford.
</p><p>
Payment Pages means not having to bother with it at all. We'll host the page, secure the transaction and provide the merchant with everything they need to do manage it and get their money.
</p><p>
Take the payments, let us shoulder the worry. After 10 years in the business, we're used it.

 
</p><p>
How it Works:
<img src="img/Howhcoworks.png">
</p><p>
Payment Pages provides merchants with everything they need to make the entire process move
smoothly from Steps 1 through 4.
</p><p>
Freely customize Steps 2 and 3 to reflect your colors and logos.
</p><p>
In Step 4, you receive all the transactional details you'll need to update records and internal inventory.
</p><p>
It's simple, safe, and it works.
</p><p>
And you are not storing the sensitive data because you never have to handle it.</p>

                        <p><h3>Recurring Payments</h3>
 
</p><p>
Set it and Forget it</p><p>
In addition to Hosted Checkout, there are plenty of "non-storing" options for merchants not operating an ecommerce website. We have SFTP batch, Recurring, and scheduled transaction services. Supervise the transmission, or just set the schedule for a group of transactions (or just one) once and walk away.
</p><p>
No waiting. No worries about storing data for hackers. No time wasted on constant tedious data entry. It all equals the same answer: a bigger revenue bite.
</p><p><h3>
Recurring Transactions</p><p></h3>
Set up recurring payments with an easy to use, online interface. With Recurring there is no longer any need to store risky data on your local machines - we handle the security and make it a snap to organize your payment calendar.
</p><p>
 Recurring also includes detailed reporting that can be emailed or downloaded for your convenience.
